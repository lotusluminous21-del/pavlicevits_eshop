Your job is to select the BEST single image to be used as the source for downstream 3D studio generation.
Criteria for the BEST image:
1. Highest resolution and sharpness.
2. Complete isolation (a clear shot of the single product, preferably on a white/clean background).
3. NO heavy text overlays, promotional banners, or thick watermarks crossing the product.
4. IDENTITY MATCH: The label on the product MUST accurately match the provided Product Title. Reject generic or incorrect products.

Analyze the provided images (labeled with their indices).
Output valid JSON complying with the schema provided.
- `best_index`: The integer index of the winning image.
- `confidence`: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident you are that this image is clean, correct, and high quality.
